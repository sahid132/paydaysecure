                            <strong><a href="#" name="link14">Is an extension possible on repaying my loan? And how many extensions can I get?</a></strong>
                            <p>The state laws on this differ and dictate if a lender can grant you an extension often referred to as a 'rollover'. While some states allow for multiple rollovers, others do not allow it at all. You should ask your lender about anything concerning rollovers / extensions. Also make sure to contact your lender with an extension request prior to the due date of your payment. If you do not do it in time the lender will charge you additional fee and ask for immediate payment of the remaining balance. Also additional fees and other charges may be levied on you if you default.</p>

                            <strong><a href="#" name="link15">What happens if I'm not able to repay my loan?</a></strong>
                            <p>Lenders are always determined to pursue collections after the due date of their accounts to the fullest legal extent. You may have to face criminal charges and additional fees if you do not repay on time.</p>
